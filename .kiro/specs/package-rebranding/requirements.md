# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves completely rebranding a forked Dart package from "youtube_explode_dart" to "youtube_explode_dart_plus", resetting the version to 1.0.0, and clearing the changelog to start fresh. This ensures the forked package has its own distinct identity while maintaining all existing functionality.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want to update all documentation and examples, so that they reflect the new package name and branding.

### Requirement 5

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN renaming library files THEN the system SHALL rename "youtube_explode_dart_plus.dart" to "youtube_explode_dart_plus.dart"
2. WHEN updating library declarations THEN the system SHALL update the library name in the main dart file
3. WHEN updating exports THEN the system SHALL ensure all exports reference the correct new library name

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want to update test files, so that they import and reference the correct new package name.

#### Acceptance Criteria
